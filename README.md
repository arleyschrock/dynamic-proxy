# Dynamic-proxy
Async-enabled proxy generator with support for either compile-time or runtime 
based generation.  By "proxy generator" we mean being able to take an existing 
class or interface and inject an interceptor that can generically handle each 
method in the source type and choose when and whether to pass the invocation off
to the original implementation (if any).  The idea is similar to [Castle's 
DynamicProxy](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/dynamicproxy/) but in 
contrast to that library, *Dynamic-proxy* is fully async/await enabled.  By that, we 
mean the methods around which you are proxying can return `Task` or `Task<T>` 
and your *interceptor* itself can use `async` and `await` without having to 
fuss with awkward uses of `.ContinueWith`.

## Installation

Install using nuget:

    Install-Package Dynamic-proxy
	
## Getting Started

To get started we'll demonstrate a simple example using a virtual method in a 
base class.  We will proxy that class and intercept the method, logging to a 
`StringWriter` (asynchronously!) both before and after **proceeding** to the 
original implementation.  This sample will use the `Reflection.Emit` version 
because there are fewer dependencies and is thus simper for a first example.

To start, let's consider the following class:

    public class HelloWorldPrinter
    {
        public async virtual Task SayHello(TextWriter writer)
        {
            await writer.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
        }
    }

Ordinarilly, you could use this method like so:

    var writer = new StringWriter();
    await new HelloWorldPrinter().SayHello(writer);

This would result in the string "Hello World!" being written to your 
`StringWriter`.  But now let's use a proxy to change the data written to the 
writer such that the full string written is:

> John says, "Hello World!"

 `HelloWorldPrinter` can stay the same, but the callsite will change to:

    1) var writer = new StringWriter();
    2) var printer = Proxy.CreateProxy<HelloWorldPrinter>(async invocation =>
    3) {
    4)    await writer.WriteAsync("John says, \"");
    5)    await invocation.Proceed();
    6)    await writer.WriteAsync("\"");
    7)    return null;
    8) });
    9) await printer.SayHello(writer);

Here we're storing off the printer in a separate variable (for clarity) and 
creating a proxy around `HelloWorldPrinter` with an invocation handler responsible
for handling the method's interception.  Let's break this down into smaller pieces:

1. We create the proxy itself via `Proxy.CreateProxy<HelloWorldPrinter>(...)`
2. The argument to `CreateProxy` expects a function that either returns an 
`object` or returns a `Task<object>`.  The latter demonstrates async semantics,
so we'll use that for our example.
3. The argument passed to your function is an instance of `Invocation` (more 
details on that later)  For now, suffice to say that it allows us to invoke the 
original behavior of the `SayHello` method at a time of our choosing.
4. Line 4) asynchronously writes the string `John says, "` to the writer.
5. Line 5) asynchronously calls the original implementation of `SayHello`, which 
writes the string `Hello World!` to the writer.
6. Line 6) asynchronously closes the quotation by writing `"` to the writer.
7. Finally, we invoke `SayHello` as before on line 9).

The end result of this is the string `John says, "Hello World!"` written to the 
writer as we expected. 


## Overview

At a high-level there are a handful of concepts that you should understand to take full
advantage of this library.

* Generator Types
* The `Invocation` object passed to your handler
* Proxies around unimplemented methods vs. those with existing behavior.
* Target-based proxies
* In-place proxies (requires the Fody version of the generator described below)

### Generator Types

*Dynamic-proxy* provides two key ways of generating the proxy.  One uses 
`Reflection.Emit` and is simple and works out of the box.  (it has no dependencies)
However, it has two key limitations:

* It requires `Reflection.Emit` -- this is a problem for iOS apps.
* It requires that proxy'd methods be virtual or that the proxy type be an interface (and
that the type be public).

Furthermore, any costs associated with generating a proxy (admitedly fairly minimal) are incurrred
at runtime rather than compile time.

If any of these concerns are paramount, *Dynamic-proxy* provides an alternative generator
that uses [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody). This is a tool that allows the proxies
to be generated at compile-time.  This addresses all the aforementioned issues. The 
downsides of using Fody are minimal:

* The generation happens at compile-time, so any penalty incurred for generating proxies
must be dealt with every time you compile. So, for example, it can (very slightly) slow 
down your iterations when leveraging TDD.
* On your proxy'd type you must either:
    * Decorate it with the `[Proxy]` attribute
    * Implement the interface `IProxy`
    
Generally speaking, we'd recommend using the Fody implementation since the costs are 
negligible and the benefits are useful.  For example, you can proxy on any method, 
regardless of whether it's marked as `virtual` or `private` and the declaring type 
itself can be private or internal, which is not possible with `Reflection.Emit`.

### The `Invocation` object passed to your handler

Your invocation handler is what is responsible for defining what happens when your 
methods are intercepted. The value returned by your invocation handler is what will 
be returned to the caller of the intercepted method.  If the method's return type is
`void`, then you must still return null (since the invocation handler has a non-void 
return type).  

In scenarios in which you have an existing implementation you'd like to invoke (as in 
our **Getting Started** example where we still wanted to enlist the default 
implementation that wrote `Hello World!` to the writer), there is a method on the 
`Invocation` object called `Proceed`:

    public abstract Task<object> Proceed();
    
There are two important points about this method signature:
* It returns a `Task<object>` which means you may await it.  And since your invocation 
handler can also be an async method (or lambda) this is straightforward.
* It takes no arguments.  This is because the invocation handler is the same for all
the methods you may be intercepting, which could have wildly different arity.  
    
Thus, the *arguments* to your intercepted method are contained in the  `Arguments` 
property:

    public object[] Arguments { get; set; }
    
Naturally, if your method has three parameters, then this array will contain three 
elements in parameter order.  Importantly, you may *modify* this array to dynamically
change the arguments that will be passed on to the original implementation if and when
you invoke `Proceed`.


### Proxies around unimplemented methods vs. those with existing behavior.

As in the example illustrated in **Getting Started**, you can intercept methods that 
already have existing behavior.  If doing so, `Proceed` will allow you to invoke that
behavior.  In contrast, if the intercepted method is abstract or declared in an 
interface, then `Proceed` will do nothing but return the default value for the return 
type, or null if the return type is `void`.

### Target-based proxies

Sometimes you already have an existing instance of your proxy type and you want to 
modify the behavior via the 
[decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern).  Normally the 
decorator pattern requires you to manually override/implement the relevant methods, 
which of course is often exactly the right approach.  

Other times, however, the behavior you want to apply can be generalized such that you'd
rather not have to override each method individually. (for example, logging how long it 
took to invoke each method)  In such a scenario, you can use *Dynamic-proxy* to create a 
proxy where the `Proceed` method will actually invoke the method on an arbitrary 
instance of the type that you provide when instantiating your proxy.
